# Raspberry Pi Stuff
This is some scripts i use for Rasbian. All shell scripts have been tested and working on:-

Platform: Raspberry Pi 3B, Zero W  
Version : 4.4  
Link    : [[Rasbian Downloads]](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

## sys-update.sh
The first thing i do on a new install of Rasbian and that is update everything.  

## slim-pi.sh
This is a script that removes everthing that i do not want on Rasbian as they are not needed for my purposes  

## python36.sh
A script that automates the install of python 3.6 on a Raspberry Pi. This can take anywhere from 30 mins to a couple hours depending on the hardware.
